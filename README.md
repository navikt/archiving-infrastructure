# archiving-infrastructure
This repository contains docker files and scripts to run the entire archiving system locally. It also contains end-to-end tests. For a description of the whole archiving system, see [the documentation](https://github.com/navikt/archiving-infrastructure/wiki).

Run `./archiving.sh` to build and start all applications and their dependencies in Docker. If you lack permission to execute the script, run `chmod +x archiving.sh`. The script will also run end-to-end tests.
